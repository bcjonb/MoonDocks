  clout and respect of the Emperor, the Prince/ss is rising in
  the ranks of the Royal Fighter Legion. Already a record breaker
  in enemy kills the Princ/ess leads a battalion of fighters in
  the battle of Echland over the MoonDocks of Echlynn. In pursuit
  of the famous rebel Crilion, the Prince/ss's fighter is destroyed.
  The fighter suit equipped with Oxygen and Fuel, is lacking in both,
  but worst, the Prince/ss is let without his memory.
* Crilacs

  Commanders was once a parent living a simple life as a farmer. Caught

  a girl, to the rebels to save them from a life in the Academy. Still
  rebellious at heart as Evac s/he has manuevered himself to the inner
  circles of both the Crilaic Command and of the Emperor. Leading the
  ground forces on Echlynn during the battle of Echland the Evac is
  separated from his squadron. Will the Evac use this opportunity to
  defect from the Empire?
* Flian

  at the young age of 8 and immediately put to daily use the Concubine

  was the ninth attempt by CY-Alpha to produce a natural born Cyborg.
  After Niner was born CY-Alpha went even deeper underground and thought
  dead by all except a select few who help with food and training Niner
  for CY-Alpha's vision for Niner's future. Against CY-Alpha's wishes,
  Niner often runs off in the forests of Echlynn, the planet CY-Alpha
  decided to hide. Will Niner fulfill the destiny envisioned by CY-Alpha
  without meaning to?
* Droids
  * A3 Tactical Droid Serial Sigma-8, Droid infiltrator. Sigma-8 was a gift
  to the Emperor by CY-Alpha as a symbol of peace. As droids are the children
  of Cyborgs, Sigma-8 was an offering of CY-Alpha first born. Sigma-8 was also
  unique as it was CY-Alpha's first and only droid child to be given flesh and
  what CY-Alpha considers a soul. Sigma-8 not knowing his nature as a Droid is
  called Sig and has become extremely loyal to the Emperor as a son to a father.
  While Sig isn't even considered for the throne Sig has become his adopted father's
  best assasin.

# NPCs

* Emperor
  * Highly strict and highly immoral, the Emperor has usurped his father's
  throne. To add insult to injury the Emperor had his father reincarnated as
  a cyborg completely under his control. Leaving his father's amazing tactical
  experience intact he often amuses himself by sending his father and near suicide
  missions against rebel strong holds. While his son Nexum is his son next in line
  the Emperor thinks him a spoiled oaf that would lead the Empire to ruin. The Emperor
  actually has hope for an offspring of his that took over command of Royal Fighter
  Legion to earn the right to the throne. Having found that the Rebel leaders are
  meeting on the MoonDocks of Echlynn the Emperor sent his entire fighting force to Echlynn to end the
  United Rebel Alliance once and for all and perhaps giving his favorite child a chance
  to rise up the line of succession.

# Alorean Groups

# The Royal Fighter Legion

>  Lead by a Royal Prince/ss, this elite battalion of pilots use their **Strikers**
  to bring hell to the United Rebel Alliance or anyone else that endangers the
  Empire. Before the Prince/ss took command the commander defected to the Alliance
  taking with him more then half the battalion's **Strikers** along with **The Grand
  Destroyer** a state of the art command carrier designed by the commander with the
  defection in mind. To the Emperor great annoyance the commander died shortly after
  of cancer he knew he was dying of. While the RFL took it hard they soon rallied after
  their new commander and has reaffirmed their acclaim as the fierces force in the galaxy.

## The Evacarti

>  The Evacarti, Special Legionaire in the Crilaic First Order. An
  Evacartee/ss is a damned Crilac either warrior or civilian sentenced
  to a life devoted to a life in the front lines of the Crilaic military.
  Due to the nature of recruitment The Evacarti is the only place a female
  Crilac can serve as a warrior. The Evacartee/ss if Male is castrated, if
  Female the genitalia is sewed closed.
